    <h1>Ethiopia</h1>
      <p> 

     Unique among African countries, the ancient Ethiopian monarchy
     maintained its freedom from colonial rule with the exception of a short-lived Italian occupation from 1936-41. 
     In 1974, a military junta, the Derg, deposed Emperor Haile SELASSIE (who had ruled since 1930) and established 
     a socialist state. Torn by bloody coups, uprisings, wide-scale drought, and massive refugee problems, the regime
     was finally toppled in 1991 by a coalition of rebel forces, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front
    (EPRDF). A constitution was adopted in 1994, and Ethiopia's first multiparty elections were held in 1995.

         <h2> Battle of Odwa</h2>

        <p>

            On March 1, 1896, a massive Ethiopian army routed Italian forces at the Battle of Adwa. The battle marked the
             largest military triumph of an African state over a European army in the 19th century and helped Ethiopia retain 
             its independence during Europe’s “scramble for Africa.” In this lesson students read three different textbook accounts 
             of the battle – two American and one Ethiopian – to investigate the question: How did Ethiopia defeat Italy at the Battle of Adwa?
