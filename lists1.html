                          night sky is Devils River State Natural Area, the first-ever internationally designated Dark Sky Sanctuary in Texas. 
                          Given by the International Dark-Sky Association, it recognizes the park as one of the darkest sites in the world. So today, 
                          on National Look Up at the Sky Day, take a moment to do exactly that! </li>
