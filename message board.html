<p>
    A conflict between the government of Ethiopia and forces in its northern Tigray region has thrown the country into turmoil.
Fighting has been going on since November 2020, destabilising the populous country in the Horn of Africa, leaving thousands of 
people dead with 350,000 others living in famine conditions.
Eritrean soldiers are also fighting in Tigray for the Ethiopian the government. All sides have been accused of atrocities.
A power struggle, an election and a push for political reform are among several factors that led to the crisis.
In simple chunks of 100, 300 and 500 words - we explain how and why the war started.
